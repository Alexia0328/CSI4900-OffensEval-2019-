## [Detecting and Categorizing Offensive Language in Twitter messages](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/offenseval2019)

In recent years, offensive language on various social media platforms has surged. Due to the anonymity of network communication, many netizens take advantage of this feature to say something on social media that would not be considered in real life. Especially during the epidemic, people need to be isolated at home, which can easily lead to emotional loss of control, venting their emotions on social platforms, making offensive language appear more frequently.

Major technology companies have invested heavily in this problem to find effective solutions to prevent language violence in social media. Since manual screening is very time-consuming and may bring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder to workers, many studies have been devoted to automating this process.

One of the most effective strategies to solve this problem is to use computational methods to identify offenses, attacks, and hate speech in user-posted content. The task is usually modelled as a supervised classification project, where systems are trained on posts annotated with respect to the presence of some form of abusive or offensive content. A group of researchers organized an Offensive Language Detection challenge (Zampieri et al., 2019b) as part of the SemEval 2019 competition. This report covers the details of our submission to this project.

This Project has three subtasks:

**Subtask A: Offensive language identification**

**Subtask B: Automatic categorization of offense**

**Subtask C: Offense target identification**
